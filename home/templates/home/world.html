            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>
                Ashenfell is a continent roughly the size of medieval Europe,
                bordered by the Endless Ocean to the west, the Bloodstone Mountains to
                the north, the Shattered Isles to the south, what is known as the Sylvaan Tangle
                to the east and beyond that the Deadlands. The name itself is grim prophecy, ash from countless
                burnings, and the fell promise of more death to come.

        The heartland of human civilization. Rolling plains broken by fortress-cities, each surrounded by scorched earth, crops burned to deny invaders, villages razed as defensive measures.
        The soil here is dark, enriched by centuries of blood. Rivers run brown with silt from eroded battlefields.
        This is where the Duchies hold their ground, where every farm is a fortification and every farmer knows how to wield a spear.

        The buffer zone between human and Orc territory. Once this was farmland, the breadbasket of the old Empire. The first Green Tide changed that.
        Decades of warfare have rendered it nearly uninhabitable. Poisoned wells, salted earth, corpse-riddled fields. Neither side can hold it permanently, so both raid constantly.
        What few settlements remain are fortified camps, changing hands monthly. The residents are scavengers and deserters, predators and carrion-eaters. 
        This is where armies go to die, where soldiers disappear, where no one goes willingly.

        A jagged mountain range of black volcanic rock, stained red with iron deposits that give the mountains their name. 
        Once these were simply called the Highpeaks. Now they're the birthplace of the Orc tribes. The Sundering's magical energies concentrated here, warping the land itself.
        Valleys glow with strange luminescence at night. Water tastes of copper. The very air seems to vibrate with barely contained violence.

      <div class="accordion-body">What humans call a "forest" is to the Elves an entire nation. Trees here grow 300 feet tall, their canopy so thick the forest floor exists in perpetual twilight.
        Ancient ruins dot the landscape, towers of impossible crystal geometry, roads paved with silver that never tarnishes, fountains that flow with water unchanged for millennia.
        But now these marvels are overgrown, crumbling, forgotten.
        The forest itself is alive—not metaphorically, literally. Trees move to block invading armies. Roots strangle those who enter with hostile intent. 
        The Elves don't defend their borders; the forest does it for them. But even this ancient magic is fading.</div>

      <div class="accordion-body">Beyond the Sylvan Tangle lies something worse than warfare: oblivion. The Deadlands are where the Sundering hit hardest. Reality itself is unstable here.
        Time moves strangely, step into a clearing and emerge days later, though to you it was minutes. Gravity falters. Colors don't look right. The dead don't stay buried.
        No faction claims this territory. It cannot be conquered. The few expeditions that ventured into the Deadlands either never returned or came back... changed. Twisted.
        The Elves have sealed the eastern border of their forest, and even the Orcs won't venture past the Stormwall Mountains.</div>
