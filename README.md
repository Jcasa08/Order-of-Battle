# Order of Battle

The purpose of this project is to develop an 'army builder' webapp for the brand Order of Battle, it is designed to allow users to create army lists for their chosen faction as well as learn about the setting of the game.

A site user should be able to view lore and information about the world, factions and units of the game. If registered, users will also be able to create and manage army lists for their chosen faction(s).

In terms of design, I wanted to create a gritty feel to match the tone of the setting, without affecting readability of the site. The layout was designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with various call to actions to help the site user.
